## 1. Setup your Atlas cluster 

### Create Your MongoDB Atlas Cluster
If you already have a MongoDB Atlas account, log in and create a new Atlas cluster. If you do not have an account, you can set up a free cluster at the following URL: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud. Once your account is set up, you can create a new Atlas cluster by using the “+ New Cluster” dialog. MongoDB provides a free tier for Google Cloud.

Once you provide a cluster name and click on “create,” Atlas will take approximately five to seven minutes to create your Atlas cluster.
